Latest iteration of pleepbot.

In need of another rewrite.

Framework used for the Twitch bot, Twitchio, has started to restrict a lot what I can do with the bot. I have also learned a lot of new stuff on techonologies and project organization. This project also lacks tests. To allow scaling, testability, and deployability, a complete rewrite is needed keeping those in mind. Also, I don't like dynamic typing of Python in this large project.

I'm rewriting the whole thing, again, with new additions in Rust https://github.com/Kazzuun/pleepbot-rs
